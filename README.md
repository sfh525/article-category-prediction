## Credits
Credits goes to my colleague Bambang Abhinawa Pinakasakti for contributing to this project. 

## Intro
This project is meant to be used as a learning opportunity to familiarize ourselves with processing text and working with deep learning libraries such as Torch and TensorFlow. It is part of the project that members of Data Science and Artificial.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aashita/nyt-comments

## Result and Potential Improvements
There were 2 approaches that we worked on, each with their varying results. The traditional TensorFlow/Torch model could only achieve an F1 score of 0.1, while the BERT pretrained model achieves an F1 score of 0.71. Potential improvements include larger dataset, more sophisticated model, and setting less neurons to prevent overfitting. 

## Runnning the Notebook
This notebook can be run in any environment you would like. Make sure to match the directory of the dataset and install all the necessary dependencies. # article-category-prediction
